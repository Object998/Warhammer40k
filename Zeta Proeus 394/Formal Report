### Theater of Operations

1. **Palmerinah - Forgotten Metropolis of Snivelling Psychopaths**
   Palmerinah served as the initial battleground, where Chaos forces, led by the **Revellers of Martial Combat** and the **Undercult of Feculent Wrath**, attempted to establish a foothold. The **Honoured Cavalry of Lathitzad** spearheaded the defense with disciplined shock tactics, driving back the enemy forces. The metropolis’ complex urban landscape played to the strengths of the **Sondhean Cemetery Swords**, who launched a devastating flanking maneuver through forgotten alleyways. This led to the collapse of Chaos resistance in Palmerinah within the first week of combat.
2. **Gherick's Forge - Besieged Warren of Hapless Fighters**
   The Chaos forces, bolstered by the **Drones of Affliction** and the **Renegades Unrepentant**, entrenched themselves in Gherick's Forge, turning it into a fortress of despair. The Imperium deployed the **Endrasha Fireguards** and the **Mantis Tigers** to lead a sustained siege. Arakiel Ashereios, demonstrating his ruthless pragmatism, ordered the use of incendiary traps, cutting off the enemy’s supply lines and reducing their morale. Gherick's Forge fell after a harrowing two-week engagement, with the **Gamomxian Rough Gatekeepers** securing the final breach through a combination of brute force and precision strikes.
3. **Omneradon - Blockaded Spire of Sickly Chymists**
   The tall spire of Omneradon became the stronghold of the **Iron Sorcerers** and the **Ashen Scorpions**, who held the high ground with the use of dark sorcery and chemical warfare. The **Spears of the Zodiac** and the **Sancean Cemetery Riders** were deployed in a coordinated assault, neutralizing the Chaos sorcerers' wards. Arakiel Ashereios personally led the final charge, cutting through the **Iron Sorcerers** in single combat and securing the spire for the Imperium. The victory at Omneradon was pivotal, as it severed the Chaos forces' arcane communications with their off-world allies.
4. **Hadon Cluster - Polluted Hell-Hole of Desperate Gene-Hackers**
   The Hadon Cluster was the most contested and hazardous region, as the **Afflicted of the Alluring Canker** and the **Heretics of Ruination** had genetically modified their forces to withstand the planet’s toxic environment. The **Legion of Dominance** and **Storm of the Anvil** were deployed here, engaging in some of the bloodiest and most brutal fighting of the entire campaign. The Imperium forces utilized aerial bombardments and precision strikes to eliminate key enemy positions. However, it was the deployment of Arakiel Ashereios and his elite warriors that ultimately broke the Chaos lines. In a final, decisive assault, Ashereios personally slew the enemy warlord, shattering the morale of the Chaos forces and securing victory in the Hadon Cluster.
5. **Balronas - Wretched Ghetto of Influential Tyrants**
   The final battle for Zeta Proeus 394 took place in Balronas, where the remnants of the **Eightfold Rampagers**, **Sires Insatiable**, and **Discordant Thralls** had established a last-ditch defense. The **Mantis Tigers** led the initial breakthrough, creating a breach in the Chaos defenses. The **Sancean Cemetery Riders** then swept through the ghetto, eliminating the remaining Chaos leadership. In this final engagement, Arakiel Ashereios personally confronted and executed several high-ranking Chaos champions, ensuring the complete collapse of enemy resistance.
