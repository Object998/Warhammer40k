**Name**: Arakiel Ashereios
**Title**: Pitiless Warrior of the Ultima Heart
**Affiliation**: Imperium of Man
**Campaign**: Zeta Proeus 394 – Wickramasinghe Fields Sector
**Role**: Commander of Imperial Forces

### Early Life and Background

Arakiel Ashereios was born into the warrior caste on Ultima Heart, a world known for producing some of the most hardened and unyielding soldiers within the Imperium. Trained from an early age in both the arts of war and the strict martial doctrines of the Imperium, Arakiel quickly rose through the ranks of his planet’s defense forces. His rise was marked by a brutal efficiency, uncompromising discipline, and a relentless pursuit of perfection in combat.

Ashereios was recruited into the elite forces of the Imperium after his leadership during the Skelborn Uprisings, where he displayed both tactical genius and personal prowess in quelling a heretical rebellion. From there, his career continued its meteoric ascent as he commanded numerous successful campaigns against the xenos and heretical forces that threatened the Imperium. His most notable action prior to the Zeta Proeus 394 campaign was the victory at the Siege of Olnath, where his strategic use of attrition warfare brought the enemy to its knees.

### Role in the Zeta Proeus 394 Campaign

In the war for Zeta Proeus 394, Arakiel Ashereios was assigned overall command of the Imperial forces tasked with eradicating the entrenched Chaos legions. His experience in leading harsh and bloody campaigns across hostile environments made him the ideal candidate for the leadership of such a critical military operation. Under his command were some of the Imperium’s finest and most specialized regiments, including the **Honoured Cavalry of Lathitzad**, the **Mantis Tigers**, and the **Legion of Dominance**.

The war on Zeta Proeus 394 was a grueling affair, and Ashereios quickly demonstrated the qualities that would mark him as one of the Imperium’s most effective leaders. His tactical acumen, indifference to personal hardship, and focus on achieving total victory at any cost became hallmarks of his leadership. Below are key actions that cemented Arakiel Ashereios' legacy.

### Tactical Brilliance and Key Engagements

1. **The Cleansing of Palmerinah**
   Palmerinah, the initial battleground of the war, was an urban sprawl filled with the twisted remnants of Chaos. Here, Ashereios demonstrated his talent for precision urban warfare. He commanded the **Sondhean Cemetery Swords** and **Honoured Cavalry of Lathitzad** in a pincer movement that caught the Chaos forces, including the **Revellers of Martial Combat**, completely off-guard. The use of smoke cover, well-coordinated ambushes, and targeted assaults into enemy command points allowed the Imperium forces to cleanse the city with minimal losses, despite the ferocity of Chaos resistance.

   Ashereios' decision to prioritize the decapitation of enemy leadership, rather than engaging in a protracted battle of attrition, proved decisive. This operation showcased his ability to adapt to shifting circumstances, using the fractured urban terrain to his advantage while isolating and annihilating enemy forces with surgical precision.

2. **The Siege of Gherick's Forge**
   At Gherick’s Forge, Ashereios faced one of his most daunting challenges. Chaos forces, led by the **Renegades Unrepentant** and **Drones of Affliction**, had transformed the region into a nearly impregnable fortress. Rather than committing his forces to a direct assault, Arakiel devised a strategy that emphasized psychological and environmental warfare. He ordered the **Endrasha Fireguards** to deploy incendiary munitions, setting fire to key supply depots and fuel reserves, forcing the enemy to fight in increasingly desperate conditions.

   As Chaos forces faltered, Ashereios led a focused strike with the **Gamonxian Rough Gatekeepers**, breaching the outer defenses in a high-risk operation that saw his forces inflict catastrophic losses on the entrenched Chaos legions. His personal leadership and fearless presence on the frontlines turned the tide in what had become a grueling siege. Ashereios’ genius in siege warfare was fully realized here, as his mastery of psychological pressure and attrition led to the complete collapse of Chaos resistance.

3. **The Assault on Omneradon**
   The spire of Omneradon had long been a Chaos bastion, held by the **Iron Sorcerers** and **Ashen Scorpions**. Known for its deadly alchemical weapons and sorcerous defenses, Omneradon represented the strategic key to Chaos communications on Zeta Proeus 394. Ashereios, recognizing the importance of disabling these capabilities, coordinated a three-pronged assault. The **Spears of the Zodiac** laid waste to the Chaos-held outer defenses, while the **Sancean Cemetery Riders** stormed the lower levels of the spire.

   Arakiel Ashereios personally led the central force, confronting the Chaos sorcerers in their inner sanctum. His leadership here was a mix of physical prowess and psychological dominance, as he cut through the **Iron Sorcerers** in close combat, shattering the defenses of the spire and securing one of the most strategically important victories of the campaign. His fearless charge into the heart of Chaos command crippled their morale and disrupted their ability to coordinate effectively for the remainder of the war.

4. **The Battle of Hadon Cluster**
   The most desperate and deadly combat occurred at the Hadon Cluster, where the **Afflicted of the Alluring Canker** and the **Heretics of Ruination** had taken hold. The environmental hazards and genetically modified Chaos forces made this a near-impossible battleground for conventional forces. However, Ashereios’ adaptability shone through. He deployed a combination of heavy aerial bombardments, precision drop-pod assaults, and hazardous environment warfare tactics to systematically eliminate Chaos strongholds within the cluster.

   His most notable action here was the single-handed slaying of the Chaos warlord commanding the **Heretics of Ruination**. This victory, achieved after hours of brutal combat deep behind enemy lines, effectively shattered the coordination of Chaos forces in the region, allowing the Imperium to achieve total dominance. Arakiel’s command here proved his unmatched capability in leading troops through the most inhospitable and lethal environments, earning him further distinction as a pitiless and unstoppable force.

### Leadership and Personal Combat Prowess

Arakiel Ashereios was not only a commander of strategic brilliance but also a fearsome warrior in his own right. His reputation for leading from the front and engaging in personal combat became a defining feature of his leadership style. He was frequently seen at the forefront of battle, wielding his power blade, **Heart’s Execution**, a relic of Ultima Heart, which he used to cut down numerous Chaos champions. His presence on the battlefield served as both a rallying point for Imperial forces and a harbinger of death for the enemy.

Ashereios was known for his unrelenting discipline and the extreme demands he placed on his soldiers. Though feared by some for his ruthlessness, he was respected by all who served under him. His commitment to the Imperium and his utter disdain for weakness ensured that his forces maintained a high level of operational effectiveness throughout the campaign.

### Legacy

The victory on Zeta Proeus 394, attributed in large part to the leadership of Arakiel Ashereios, solidified his place as one of the Imperium’s greatest heroes. His ruthless determination, tactical brilliance, and personal valor set an example that continues to inspire Imperial commanders across the galaxy. His name will forever be linked to the complete destruction of the Chaos forces on Zeta Proeus 394, a campaign that stands as a testament to the power and resolve of the Imperium under his command.
